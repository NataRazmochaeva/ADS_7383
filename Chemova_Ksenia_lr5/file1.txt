All I Want For Christmas

Everybody waits for christmas
For me it's new year's day
It's gonna come and take my blues away
I'm wishing on the stars for christmas
And hoping for a better day
When it doesn't hurt to feel this way

Everywhere there's joy around this festive time of year
And happiness is never felt so far away

All of the bells ringing out for christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different so much more
All of the bells ringing out for christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for christmas is new year's day

It's only seven days 'till christmas
Six more 'till new year's day.
It's not a good time to feel this way

Everywhere the snow surrounds you
And melts your troubles away
I can only hope to feel the same

I know that we tide in this joy this time next year
But happiness is never felt so far away

All of the bells ringing out for christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different so much more
All of the bells ringing out for christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for christmas is new year's day

I remember how I used to feel at christmas

All of the bells ringing out for christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different so much more
All of the bells ringing out for christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
But all that I want this year for christmas is new year's day
